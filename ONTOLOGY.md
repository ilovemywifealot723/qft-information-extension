# Structured Information Field Ontology (SIFO)

*This document describes the minimal ontology implied by Structured Information Field Dynamics (SIFD). All terms are defined operationally in measurable quantities. Awareness and consciousness are interpretive layers; the math refers strictly to structured distinctions, scalar fields, and measurable information operators.*

## 1. Structured Distinctions

Distinctions are differences encoded in information, measurable via `O_info(x)`.  

All observable phenomena arise from patterns of stabilized distinctions in scalar fields `C_i(x)`.  

Distinctions are the fundamental operational substrate; physical objects, fields, and correlations emerge from them.

---

## 2. Awareness (Interpretive)

Awareness is conceptually the non-dynamical substrate enabling structured distinctions.  

It is never directly measured or included in equations.  

All empirical measurements occur within the constraints that awareness enables, i.e., they manifest as structured distinctions.

---

## 3. Consciousness (Interpretive)

Consciousness is the active evolution of structured distinctions, observable via changes in `O_info(x)`.  

Localized self-reflective loops in scalar fields (`Ψ_L` or `C_i(x)`) correspond to measurable conscious-like activity.  

Consciousness is fully operational in the math: it is information-processing activity, not a separate entity.

---

## 4. Thinking and Operations

Changes in `O_info(x)` represent structured operations on distinctions.  

Logical, symbolic, or sequential reasoning processes are captured as measurable evolution in the scalar fields.  

Thinking is independent of embedding but manifests in the fields `C_i(x)`.

---

## 5. Structuring and Imagination

Observed correlations in `O_info(x)` define structures (patterns, relations, rules).  

Embedding these structures in contextual constraints of SIFD fields corresponds to imagination, i.e., potential configurations of reality.  

Each realized outcome corresponds to a specific pattern of structured distinctions stabilized by scalar fields.

---

## 6. Reality as Stabilized Information

Physical reality is defined operationally as structured distinctions that persist, are self-consistent, and shared.  

Particles, fields, forces, and spacetime emerge from constraints encoded in `C_i(x)`.  

Reality is thus entirely derived from the dynamics of SIFD-constrained structured distinctions.

---

## 7. Scalar Fields as Measurable Constraints

`C_i(x)` are dynamic scalar fields that regulate the evolution of structured distinctions.  

They correspond to observable physical effects, e.g., gravitational or electromagnetic interactions.  

Stabilized patterns in these fields encode correlations measurable through `O_info(x)`.

---

## 8. Matter and Localized Systems

Matter arises as patterns of stabilized distinctions, constrained by scalar fields.  

Brains, devices, or other systems are interfaces expressing structured distinctions locally.  

Localized self-reflective loops in these systems are measurable as consciousness.

---

## 9. SIFD Operational Bridge

`O_info(x)` directly measures distinctions instantiated by information-processing dynamics.  

`C_i(x)` encode constraints on stabilized structures, linking measurements to the ontology.  

Empirical verification of SIFD renders this ontological reading the minimal interpretation consistent with all observations.

## 10. Field Content, Action, and Equations of Motion

Scalar fields `C_i(x)` on Minkowski spacetime:  

```
S = ∫ d^4x [
  L_standard
  + Σ_i ( 1/2 ∂_μ C_i ∂^μ C_i − 1/2 m_i^2 C_i^2 )
  − V_int(C_i)
  + Σ_i ε_i C_i(x) O_info(x)
]
```

Equations of motion:  

```
□ C_i + m_i^2 C_i + ∂V_int / ∂C_i = − ε_i O_info(x)
dρ/dt = −i [ H_standard + Σ_i ε_i C_i(x) O_info(x), ρ ]
```

Hermiticity ensures unitarity. `O_info(x)` measures structured distinctions.  

Recovery of standard physics occurs in the limit `ε_i → 0`.

---

## 11. Falsifiability

Null hypothesis: `ε_i = 0`.  

Non-observation of predicted deviations constrains or rules out the framework.  

Empirical verification operationally enforces the ontology.
