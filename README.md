## Structured Information Field Dynamics (SIFD)

*Information is not merely descriptive — it is physically real. SIFD formalizes this, treating structured information as a measurable, causal component of physical systems.*

Abstract

We propose a minimal, experimentally testable extension of quantum field theory in which one or more real scalar fields couple to Hermitian, operationally defined structured information operators derived from measurable properties of physical systems. This framework is a strict extension: it recovers standard quantum dynamics exactly in the limit of vanishing coupling.

The interaction is defined operationally in terms of persistent, bounded, and noise-resistant informational structure, expressed via correlation functions, reduced density matrices, or other physically accessible observables, with explicit coarse-graining and renormalization prescriptions. The model makes concrete, falsifiable predictions for laboratory systems such as superconducting qubits, photonic lattices, and mesoscopic coherent devices.

Non-observation of the predicted effects constrains or rules out the proposed couplings.

1. Motivation

Quantum field theory successfully describes fundamental interactions but treats information as bookkeeping rather than as a potential dynamical quantity.

Quantum information science demonstrates that correlations, coherence, and persistent structure are physically real, measurable, and technologically controllable properties of matter.

This framework addresses the narrow, testable question:

Can persistent, structured information in physical systems act as a source term for additional dynamical degrees of freedom without modifying standard quantum theory?

No assumptions are made about subjective experience or agency.

### Foundational Rationale

Quantum Field Theory predicts how fields behave but not why they act at all. If QFT is truly fundamental, stopping at behavior leaves a gap: the origin of interaction itself is unexplained. SIFD fills this gap by treating structured, measurable information as a dynamical input, formalizing what it means for a field to respond to a system. This makes SIFD not just an extension of QFT, but a necessary step toward understanding the very basis of physical action.

2. Scope and Non-Claims

This framework is not:

• A theory of consciousness or subjective experience  
• A collapse model  
• A modification of the Born rule  
• An ontological interpretation of quantum mechanics  

It is a conservative effective field theory extension designed solely for empirical falsification.

3. Field Content and Action

Introduce one or more real scalar fields C_i(x) on Minkowski spacetime.

```text
S = ∫ d^4x [
  L_standard
  + Σ_i ( 1/2 ∂_μ C_i ∂^μ C_i − 1/2 m_i^2 C_i^2 )
  − V_int(C_i)
  + Σ_i ε_i C_i(x) O_info(x)
]
```

Where:

• L_standard is the baseline QFT Lagrangian  
• V_int(C_i) is a bounded self-interaction ensuring vacuum stability  
• ε_i are small EFT couplings  
• O_info(x) is a renormalized, Hermitian scalar operator  

---

4. Dimensional Normalization

Units: ℏ = c = 1

```text
[C_i] = 1
[O_info] = 3
[ε_i] = 0
```

---

5. Lorentz / Frame Definition

SIFD is explicitly an open-system, laboratory-frame EFT.

• O_info(x) is defined in the rest frame of the experimental apparatus  
• Full Lorentz covariance is not assumed for O_info  
• The scalar fields C_i remain relativistic  

---

6. Structured Information Operator (Operational Definition)

```text
O_info(x) = Z_info^−1 ∇^2 ⟨ ρ_info(x) ⟩_smooth
```

Where:

• ρ_info is constructed from reduced density matrices, correlation functions, or coherence measures  
• ⟨…⟩_smooth denotes coarse-graining over a fixed scale  
• Z_info is a composite-operator renormalization constant  

---

7. Equations of Motion

Scalar field equation:

```text
□ C_i + m_i^2 C_i + ∂V_int / ∂C_i = − ε_i O_info(x)
```

Density matrix evolution:

```text
dρ/dt = −i [ H_standard + Σ_i ε_i C_i(x) O_info(x) , ρ ]
```

Hermiticity of O_info ensures unitarity.

---

8. Recovery of Standard Physics

In the strict limit:

```text
ε_i → 0
```

All new terms vanish identically and standard quantum mechanics and quantum field theory are recovered exactly.

---

9. Falsifiability

Null hypothesis:

```text
ε_i = 0
```

Non-observation of deviations constrains or rules out the framework.
