## Abstract

We propose a minimal, experimentally testable extension of quantum field theory in which one or more real scalar fields couple to structured information operators derived from measurable properties of physical systems. This framework is a strict extension: it recovers standard quantum dynamics exactly in the limit of vanishing coupling.

The interaction is defined operationally in terms of persistent, bounded, and noise-resistant informational structure, expressible via correlation functions, density operators, or other physically accessible measures. The model makes concrete, falsifiable predictions for systems such as superconducting qubits, photonic lattices, and mesoscopic coherent devices. Non-observation of the predicted effects immediately constrains or rules out the proposed couplings.

This work enables direct empirical testing of whether structured information can play a role in physical dynamics beyond what standard quantum theory predicts.

## 1. Motivation

Quantum field theory is extraordinarily successful, yet it remains agnostic about whether information itself could have a direct, operationally relevant role in dynamics, beyond entropy or statistical bookkeeping.

Quantum information theory, decoherence studies, and experiments on complex quantum systems highlight the importance of correlations, coherence, and stable informational patterns in real devices.

Separately, some research programs explore whether consciousness—if it has a physical substrate—might connect to minimal, testable physical degrees of freedom. This framework does not assume anything about consciousness. Instead, it addresses the narrower, concrete question:

> Can persistent, structured information in physical systems couple to new dynamical degrees of freedom in a way that produces measurable deviations from standard quantum dynamics?

## 2. Scope and Non-Claims

This framework is not:

- A theory of subjective experience  
- A collapse model  
- A replacement for quantum mechanics or quantum field theory  
- Dependent on philosophical assumptions or ontological interpretations  

It is a minimal, falsifiable extension of QFT designed purely for experimental testability.

## 3. Field Content and Action

Introduce one or more real scalar fields `C_i(x)` on Minkowski spacetime. The total action is:

```text
S = ∫ d^4x [
    L_standard
  + Σ_i (1/2 ∂_μ C_i ∂^μ C_i − 1/2 m_i^2 C_i^2)
  − V_int(C_i)
  + Σ_i ε_i C_i(x) O_info(x)
]
```

Where:

- `L_standard` is the Standard Model (or other baseline QFT) Lagrangian  
- `V_int(C_i)` is a bounded self-interaction potential  
- `ε_i` are small, experimentally tunable coupling constants  
- `O_info(x)` is a structured information operator  

---

## 4. Structured Information Operator (Operational Definition)

```text
O_info(x) = ∇^2 ⟨ρ_info(x)⟩
```

Here, `ρ_info` may represent:

- Reduced density matrices  
- Correlation functions  
- Stability or coherence measures  
- Local entropy or mutual information density  

This applies to quantum, classical, and hybrid systems without assuming semantics or phenomenology.

---

## 5. Equations of Motion

```text
□ C_i + m_i^2 C_i + ∂V_int/∂C_i = − ε_i O_info(x)
```

```text
dρ/dt = −i [ H_standard + Σ_i ε_i C_i(x) O_info(x), ρ ]
```

All symbols are explicitly defined within this framework.

---

## 6. Parameter Domain and Stability

- Couplings `ε_i` are small and bounded to ensure perturbative control  
- Self-interaction potentials maintain vacuum stability  
- Framework is well-posed in perturbative and non-perturbative regimes  

---

## 7. Recovery of Standard Physics

In the strict limit:

```text
ε_i → 0
```

- All new terms vanish  
- Standard quantum mechanics and quantum field theory are exactly recovered  
- No residual effects remain  

---

## 8. Falsifiability and Null Hypothesis

```text
Null hypothesis: ε_i = 0
```

Predictions if `ε_i ≠ 0`:

- Measurable deviations in systems with persistent structured information  

Falsification:

- Absence of deviations constrains `ε_i`  
- Strong null results can rule out the framework entirely  

---

## 9. Experimental Targets

### 9.1 Superconducting Qubits
- Compare decoherence rates between systems with structured vs. randomized information encoding.

### 9.2 Photonic Lattices
- Measure phase stability or propagation fidelity under coherent vs. scrambled mode structures.

### 9.3 Mesoscopic Coherent Systems
- Detect low-frequency noise correlated with persistent informational patterns.

> Each experiment compares physically identical systems differing only in informational structure, maximizing sensitivity to the proposed coupling.

## 10. Urgency and Testability

- Feasible with current or near-term technology  
- No exotic particles or energy scales required  
- Allows direct empirical resolution rather than philosophical debate  

---

## 11. Limitations

- No claims about subjective experience  
- No claims about interpretive metaphysics  
- Framework can be ruled out entirely by experiment  

These are explicit design features, not oversights.

---

## 12. Summary

This work presents a complete, conservative, and falsifiable extension of quantum field theory. Scalar fields couple to operationally defined structured information operators.

- Mathematically well-posed  
- Experimentally accessible  
- Reduces exactly to standard quantum physics in the limit of vanishing couplings  

Optional interpretive discussion is provided in `ONTOLOGY.md` and introduces no additional physical assumptions.
